Tux and Boris were out having a nice
picnic smoking a fat one.
Suddenly, a creature jumped from
behind an ice bush, there was a flash,
and Boris fell asleep!

When Boris wakes up, he finds that his cigar 
case is missing. Where it lay before now
lies a letter. \"Boris, my arch-enemy\"
says the letter. \"I have stolen
your cuban cigars and have taken
her to my fortress to 
smuggle to the US.
Give up on the thought of trying to
buy more, you were banned from cuba 
3 years ago and that was your last pack.
-Nolok\"

Boris looks and sees Nolok's fortress in
the distance. Not motivated in the slightest,
 He sends tux to retrieve them"
